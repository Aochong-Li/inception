If the river is 84 meters wide and 100 meters long, and the storm adds water at a rate of 2500 cubic meters per hour, how long will it take for the water to fully cover two third of the river's area?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me think about the area of the river. The river is 84 meters wide and 100 meters long. To find the total area, I multiply these two numbers: 84 * 100 = 8400 square meters. The problem is that the water needs to cover two thirds of this area. So, two thirds of 8400 would be (2/3) * 8400 = 5600 square meters. But that's only considering the area, not the depth of the water. Since the problem is about the time it takes for the water to reach this area, maybe I should think about the surface area in relation to the total fill volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, because if the storm adds water on top of the current water level, and the river is still at the lower levels, then the water depth would be affected by the initial rise but the extent of coverage is still considered as the base area of the river. So, since the water rises to 7.5 meters, but we need the water to cover 5600 square meters. But the problem isn't clear if the 7.5 meters is directly related to the filling process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Let's assume that the initial depth is zero, and that the 2500 cubic meters per hour represent the volume of water being added per hour. Let's see: the total area is covered by 5600 square meters. The volume of water added per area is 2500 cubic meters per 5600 square meters, which is 2500 / 5600 = ~0.4468 cubic meters per square meter. But this seems too small to be relevant. Maybe the problem is a bit different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the total volume of water is being added, not the area. Since the river is 100 meters long and 84 meters wide, and the storm is adding water at 2500 cubic meters per hour. The problem is to find the time it takes for the addition of water to result in the coverage of the area. Therefore, perhaps we need to find how long it would take to add 2500 * X cubic meters where X is the number of hours, such that the total volume of water is the correct height.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, here's a bit confused. If the total volume of water to add is given as 2500 cubic meters per hour, and the water level is raised by 7.5 meters, but the question is not concerned with the depth. The question just wants the time to cover two-thirds of the total area. So perhaps the following approach might make sense:\n",
      "\n",
      "If the river's volume is 8400 square meters * 7.5 meters = 63000 cubic meters. The question wants to know how long it will take to add enough water to cover 5600 square meters, which would be 2500 cubic meters per hour. Because 5600 square meters can be covered with 2500 cubic meters (since 2500 cubic meters per area X). Wait, but that's not correct. Maybe the question is not directly about that. Let me check.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the problem says \"the storm adds water at a rate of 2500 cubic meters per hour, how long will it take for the water to fully cover two third of the river's area?\" 2500 cubic meters per hour would be enough to cover 5600 square meters if the water rises to 7.5 meters. But this is confusing. Let me rephrase the problem:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The river's area is 84 * 100 = 8400 square meters.\n",
      "- Two-thirds of the area is 8400 * (2/3) = 5600 square meters.\n",
      "- The total volume added is 2500 cubic meters per hour.\n",
      "- The question is: How long will it take for the water to be raised to the height of 7.5 meters to cover 5600 square meters of the river's surface?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Wait, the problem is not about the total volume of water, but the amount of water added by the storm to raise the level by 7.5 meters. Then the question is, how long it takes to reach that height. However, the rate given is 2500 cubic meters per hour, meaning that in one hour, 2500 cubic meters is added. But this is per hour, but considering the total river area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the surface area of the river when the water is 7.5 meters high is not 8400 square meters, but a different value. Since the width is 84 meters and the length is 100 meters. When the water is 7.5 meters high, the surface area is 84 * 7.5 = 630 square meters. So the problem is to find how long it takes to add water to the river to raise the surface height to 7.5 meters and also cover 5600 square meters of the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem says, \"the storm adds water at a rate of 2500 cubic meters per hour,\" which is the rate for each square meter of surface area. So to cover 5600 square meters with a 7.5 meter depth, the total volume would be 5600 * 7.5 = 42000 cubic meters. Which is way more than the 2500 cubic meters per hour. So this approach is not correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but maybe the question is not considering the total volume but the rate in terms of the area. The given rate is 2500 cubic meters per hour. Let's think back to the problem: \"how long it will take for the water to fully cover two third of the river's area.\" So, two third of the total surface area is 5600 square meters. Since the rate is 2500 cubic meters per hour, which would add 2500 cubic meters in one hour. Then the time to add 2500 cubic meters is 1 hour. Therefore, the answer would be 1 hour. But this seems too straightforward, and maybe I'm missing something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the problem says \"raising the flood level by 7.5 meters.\" So, if the water is 7.5 meters high, then that's the depth. The volume of water added by that height would be the volume of the water (bounded by the surface height) but if we think of the total volume of water added is 2500 cubic meters per hour. However, I think this is a more complex problem. Let me check again:\n",
      "\n",
      "The total surface area when it's filled to 7.5 meters is 84 * 7.5 = 630 square meters. But the question is to find how long it takes to add a volume of water that's enough to cover approximately 5600 square meters. Wait, that's not possible. For example, if we have 630 square meters (for each height), then adding 5600 square meters would require adding water to a depth that is 630 * something. Which is not right because the volume is being added to the overall surface area.\n",
      "\n",
      "So perhaps I need to think differently. The total volume of water (the water that's covered by height and area) is 7.5 meters * 84 * 100 = 630 *100= 63000 cubic meters. But the question says \"two third of the river's area\" which would be 5600 square meters. But this is the area, not the total volume. Maybe the problem is saying that you need to raise the level by 7.5 meters over the total area. Wait, so the total volume of water that is being added is 2500 cubic meters per hour. The time to add enough water to cover 5600 square meters (which is the only part of the problem that's important). Wait, that's a different angle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes! The key here is that the rate of 2500 cubic meters per hour is the volume added per hour. So, if you need to add water for 2500 cubic meters to cover two-thirds of the river's area, the total volume would be 2500 cubic meters per hour * time. Since two-thirds of the total area is 5600 square meters, the total volume that can be added in that time is 5600 square meters, multiplied by the height of the water, which is the 7.5 meters. Therefore, the volume needed is 5600 *7.5 = 42000 cubic meters. But that is not the case. Wait, maybe the problem is designed to mislead. Maybe the total volume requirement is not directly related to the surface area.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this seems too convoluted. Let me try again. The problem states that \"the river is 84 meters wide, 100 meters long, and the storm adds water at a rate of 2500 cubic meters per hour\". So, to cover 5600 square meters, each with depth of 7.5 meters. Wait, this is actually not possible. Because if the total volume that is added is 2500 cubic meters per hour for a total volume of 42000 cubic meters. Wait, that's not how it works. The answer is going to be 1 hour? Because otherwise, the storm would have to add 42000 cubic meters per hour which is 42000/2500 = 16.8 hours. But that's not the answer. Unless the question is asking for a different approach. Let me try to find out where I went wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, here's the breakdown again. The river's total volume is 84*100*7.5 = 63000 cubic meters. The question is about covering two-thirds of the area with water. So, 5600 square meters is two-thirds of the total area. However, this 5600 square meters is the area which is to be covered by the water. Therefore, the volume of water needed is 2500 cubic meters per hour * how many hours? Suppose, for example, that the water is added at a depth of 7.5 meters and fills 5600 square meters. But perhaps the total volume of water added is 5600 *7.5 = 42000 cubic meters. But that's not correct. The problem is not about the total volume of water, but the rate of addition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe the problem is saying that the water is added at 7.5 meters height (which is the solution that is wrong). Or perhaps, the water is added in such a way that the depth is 7.5 meters. But in that case, the volume is calculated as the surface area times the depth. But here I think the two approaches can't be combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the problem is to figure out how long it takes to cover 5600 square meters. Since the width is 84, the depth is 7.5, which would be 5600 square meters. Because 84 * (something) = 5600? 5600 / 84 is about 67.9. That's not 7.5. So the problem is that the water is being added in a way that the depth is 7.5, but the surface area is 5600. Therefore, the water is being added in such a way that the total volume is added over the period in hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I think that's where the mistake is. Let me write this more mathematically. Suppose the rate is 2500 m^3/hour. The total time required is 2500 * t = volume. But that's not the correct way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the problem may be stating that the storm fills the river with water, and the rate is given, but then the problem's solution is to find how that fills the river in two thirds of the area. Which seems to be a different problem. Perhaps, the question is that the storm changes the level by 7.5 meters, but the problem wants to find how long that takes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But according to my original idea, the storm needs to add 2500 m^3 per hour. Let me think again. If the storm fills the river to a depth of 7.5 meters, the total volume is 63000 cubic meters. However, if it's about the two-thirds area, then the volume would be 42000 m^3. Hence, the time required is 42000 /2500 = 16.8 hours. But that seems incorrect again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively maybe the problem is about 2500 cubic meters per hour, but the two-thirds is an odd number. For example, the problem may not want to multiply by 2500, but perhaps an alternative method.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, here's another way. If we let t be the time in hours it takes. The total volume added is 2500 * t. But that is the total volume. However, the problem says that the area is covered with 5600 square meters. But the depth given is 7.5 meters. So if the storm adds water to the surface at a certain rate, perhaps that is not considered. Because the problem might be a misunderstanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, let me think of the total volume of a one-hour period. If 2500 m^3 is added, that gives a surface area with 7.5 m high. The area would be 2500 / 7.5 = 333.33... m^2. But that's not possible. This places the plane of the water too close to the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the problem is that we have to find, how long it takes to add the necessary volume to cover two-thirds of the river's area. For example, 5600 square meters, but that's not straightforward. Let me try to think:\n",
      "\n",
      "Total volume: 2500 m^3 * t. Since the river's width is 84 and length is 100. If the rate is 2500 m^3 per hour, and the question is to find out how long.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's compute 5600 square meters. So, 5600 * 7.5 m = 42000 m^3. If that's the volume that would cover the area, but that would require a total of 2500 *t = 42000. Then t would be 42000 /2500 = 16.8. So that's the answer. However, the problem requires that the storm adds water to cover 5600 square meters. Therefore, using the rate, which is 2500 m^3 per hour, the time would be 2500 * t = 5600 (assuming the storm fills the volume necessary to reach 7.5m with the given surface) which isn't correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe, the problem is that the storm is adding enough water that increases the volume and fills the area, but the way the problem might be intended is that one has to estimate the depth if that's possible. Let me think again.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the water level is raised from 0 to 7.5m, then that's 7.5 * surface area = total volume. However, if the area is 5600 square meters, then the total volume is 7.5 * 5600 = 42000 cubic meters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back at the entire problem: \"the river is 84 meters wide and 100 meters long. The storm adds water at a rate of 2500 cubic meters per hour. How long will it take for the water to fully cover two thirds of the river's area?\" This can be written as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "2500 m^3/hour * HowManyHoursToReachArea = 5600 m^2 * 7.5 m ?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait. But the total volume is the depth times the area. Let's take the example of 2500 m^3/hour * t = 42000. So t= 42000/2500=16.8 hours. But in this case, the storm is adding 2500 cubic meters per hour, and we need this to reach the 42000 cubic meters.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if the problem is that the area is 5600 square meters, and the storm is adding water to cover that area, but then the water is rising to a height of 7.5 meters. This would lead to the problem's mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the problem is considered a trick question: suppose you have a fixed amount of water to add, but they have to figure it out in another direction. But no, in this case, the problem states that the storm adds water at the given rate, and this rate is equivalent to the volume added per hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the total volume needed is 42000 m^3, and the storm's rate is 2500 m^3 per hour. So the time would be 42000 /2500 = 16.8 hours. However, that seems too long. The correct answer is not 16.8 hours. Wait, this is why I think I made some mistakes here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another approach: maybe the height is 7.5 meters which is given, but the actual total volume is 2500 *t = 42000. Wait, maybe that is not the correct solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the problem is that the total area is 84 * 100 = 8400 square meters. The two-thirds of that is 5600 square meters, but not pertaining directly to the volume added. Wait, perhaps the answer is that it isn't straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps this is a problem where you need to think about the additional water being added to the existing water that is already in the river.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, going by the given rate and the rates, I think the problem is about the time it takes to add enough water to reach two thirds of the area. But that's not a straightforward answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, it's possible that the river is already filled with some water, but the storm is raising the level. However, the problem says the storm has filled the river, which I misunderstood. So that's the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the problem is wrong here. I think the initial assumption of the problem is correct. Therefore, the time required is 16.8 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, why is the question presented as a problem that requires \"how long it will take for...\"; perhaps, maybe there's a different way to interpret it. But perhaps this is the correct answer. Alternatively, trying to think differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait if the question is to have 5600 square meters covered, why isn't that simply 5600 square meters? That's the area. If for example, the answer is yes, then that's 16.8 hours. But maybe the problem is that the storm in this case is not adding water in a way that reaches 7.5 meters.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this analysis, the volume that's being added is 42000 cubic meters, which is equivalent to 2500 m^3 / hr * time. If that is the case, then, the time = 42000 / 2500 = 16.8 hours. Which is 1 hour 40 minutes. If that's the case, then what's the issue?\n",
      "\n",
      "But think again. The problem is that we are missing a crucial detail. Perhaps, the depth is not 7.5 meters, but maybe the rate is that when the total volume is 2500 cubic meters per hour per square meter, then 2500 cubic meters per hour added over the area. But this is not correct. Because in that case, the rate would be 2500 cubic meters per hour per square meter, but when height and width are considered. For example, if the river is 7.5 meters when adding 5600 square meter surface. Not valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, what if the storm added 2500 cubic meters of water in a certain height (for example, 10 meters of width)? But that's not helpful. The problem's key is that the volume is 2500 cubic meters per hour. But the river adds 7.5 m. But then the problem falls apart. So, I think that the answer must be that the problem is a mistake. The correct answer is going to be that 16.8 hours, regardless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way: the correct way is that the storm is adding 2500 m^3/hour. Then the total volume needed is that of a 7.5 m height. So the total volume required is 2500* time = 42000. The rate is 2500. But then time is 42000/2500 = 16.8 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus I have a different answer than before. Wait, but the problem may be that, why this is a problem? The initial misunderstanding might be that the water level is 7.5 meters, but problem says \"to fully cover two-third of the river's area.\" So perhaps the problem wants to figure out the surface area.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this case, if the depth is not 7.5 meters, then how?\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the answer could be 16.8 hours. This is the correct answer. Therefore, according to the given rate, that seems logical. So this answer is correct.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "<answer>\n",
      "Okay, so in the original problem, I think the correct way to approach it is that the storm adds water at a rate of 2500 cubic meters per hour. The key is that the goal is to have the water cover two-thirds of the river's surface area, which is 5600 square meters. Therefore, the volume that needs to be added is 2500 cubic meters per hour multiplied by the number of hours, which will equal 5600 square meters multiplied by the depth, which is 7.5 meters. However, this is not directly possible because the calculation would involve volumes of water in a way that might not be straightforward. Let me try to verify this.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the area is 5600 square meters and the depth is 7.5 meters, then the volume is 5600 *7.5 = 42000 cubic meters. But the storm adds water at 2500 cubic meters per hour. So to reach 42000 cubic meters, the problem would require that this is done in 42000 /2500 = 16.8 hours. However, when I first calculated, I thought perhaps that this is the case but that perhaps it's not correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the problem may be that the storm raises the water by some height but maybe the answer requires a different perspective. But the problem states that two-thirds of the area is 5600 square meters. Therefore, perhaps the answer is that the storm takes 16.8 hours to fill two-thirds of the area. Therefore, the correct answer would be 16.8 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I think the correct way to approach this is to accept that the problem is: \"given that the storm adds water at a rate of 2500 cubic meters per hour, and the total volume is 42000 cubic meters, which is needed to cover 5600 square meters with a depth of 7.5 meters, the time required is 16.8 hours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the final answer would be 16.8 hours. Hence, the answer is that the storm needs 16 hours and 48 minutes to cover two-thirds of the area. Therefore, the correct approach is to go with 16.8 hours.\n",

      "Alright, first, I need to visualize the parabolic path. It's a standard parabola, probably of the form y = ax², right? Or maybe it's better to express it in terms of y as a function of x or vice versa. The slope of the parabola will be important because weight is related to the component of gravitational acceleration along the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, when an object is on a path, the total gravitational force, which is mg, gets split into two components: one perpendicular to the surface (which affects the normal force, hence the normal reaction) and one tangential to the surface (which leads to acceleration). But the problem here is about the change in weight. Wait, is the weight considered here as the normal force or the actual gravitational force? Hmm, the wording says \"its weight increases by a small amount dw.\" Hmm, weight is actually the component of gravitational force perpendicular to the surface. So, perhaps the increase in weight is due to the change in the normal force as the object moves along the surface.\n",

      "Oh, but the problem states that dw is proportional to ds, so maybe it's considering the change in the component of the weight along the surface? Or perhaps the problem is about the object's weight in terms of the normal force and friction forces, but since it's just a problem of weight change, I might be overcomplicating it.\n",

      "Wait, if the surface is smooth, we don't have friction. So the weight change dw might be related to the normal force difference over the surface as the object moves from one point to another along the curve. So, if the object moves a small distance ds along the surface, the change in the normal force (which is related to the weight) would depend on how the normal force changes along the path. So, if the surface is parabolic, the slope at any point would affect the normal force.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the normal force N is equal to mg times the cosine of the angle θ between the weight and the normal force. So, N = mg cosθ. Therefore, the change in normal force dN would be equal to -mg sinθ dθ (using differentials). But since dw is the increase in weight, which might be related to the normal force, maybe dw = dN. Hmm, or is it considering the projection of weight onto the direction of motion?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the problem says \"its weight increases by a small amount dw.\" Maybe dw is the increment in weight due to the movement along the path. So, if the path has a slope, moving a small distance ds along the path would result in a small increase in weight. The increase in weight would depend on the vertical component of displacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the vertical change dz when moving a distance ds along the path can be approximated by dz ≈ ds * cosθ, and hence the weight, which is proportional to mg, would change by Δw = dw = -mg cosθ · (-dz) ≈ -mg (cosθ)(dy/ds) ds. Since the slope is dy/dx, but since we're moving along the curve, dy ≈ dz = (dy/dx) dx, and dx = ds, so dy/dx = (dy/ds). Therefore, dw ≈ -mg (dy/ds) ds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem says dw is proportional to ds, so dw = k ds, meaning that the change in weight is proportional to the distance moved. So, that suggests that k is equal to the negative of the slope times g, considering the direction. But since it's a parabolic surface, the slope could be dy/dx at a point, and if it's a function y(x), then the slope is dy/dx.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the parabola is a function y(x). So, if the path is y(x) = ax², then the slope at any point is dy/dx = 2ax. But perhaps the problem is general, so we can express k in terms of the slope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if the parabola is y(x) = ax², then the slope is 2ax. So, the change in y over the change in x is 2ax, which is the slope. Therefore, the change in weight dw would be proportional to the change in y, which is 2ax * ds. So, maybe the constant of proportionality k is 2a, assuming that the weight increase proportional to ds, and the change in weight due to moving a small distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the problem says dw is proportional to ds, so we can write dw = k ds. In the case of the normal force, the change in weight would relate to the vertical component of the displacement. So, if the normal force is proportional to weight, then the change in normal force would be proportional to the vertical change in y.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, if moving a small distance ds, the vertical change is dy ≈ ds * sinθ, where θ is the angle between the path and the horizontal. But in terms of the slope, tanθ = dy/dx, and sinθ = tanθ / sqrt(1 + tan²θ) = (dy/dx) / sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2). Alternatively, in terms of the slope m, there's a relation between dy and ds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, if the slope m = dy/dx, then moving a small distance ds in the x-direction (though actually, ds is the arc length, which is related to dx by ds = dx / sqrt(1 + m²)). But perhaps for small distances, the vertical change dz can be approximated as m dx, since dz = g ds. Wait, no, that's not clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe it's simpler to consider the weight change as dw = mg dz, where dz is the vertical displacement, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, if the object moves a small distance ds along the surface, the weight change is due to the projection along the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I should think about work. The weight is mg, and moving a small distance ds along the path, the work done against the weight might relate to the increase in weight. But the problem states that the increase in weight dw is proportional to ds, so maybe dw = k ds, and we need to find k in terms of the parabola's geometry.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the path is a parabola, y = ax², then the gravitational force is mg, and the actual component along the surface would be mg sinθ, but the problem mentions weight, which is the perpendicular component, so N = mg cosθ, and dw = dN. So, dw = -mg sinθ dl, where dl is the arc length element. But if dl ≈ ds (since we're considering small distances), then dw ≈ -mg sinθ ds. But sinθ can be expressed in terms of the slope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since slope m = dy/dx = 2ax, then tanθ = m = 2ax, so sinθ = m / sqrt(1 + m²) = (2ax) / sqrt(1 + 4a²x²). But perhaps for small distances, the x is not changing much, so the slope m is small, and maybe sinθ ≈ m. Alternatively, in the limit as ds approaches zero, m approaches dz/dx, which is the vertical change per horizontal change, so m = dy/dx.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, sinθ ≈ m / sqrt(1 + m²) ≈ m, for small m. Therefore, dw ≈ -mg (dy/dx) ds, so dw = -mg (dy/dx) ds. Therefore, the proportionality constant k would be -mg (dy/dx). However, the problem says k = dw/ds, so k = -mg (dy/dx). But dy/dx is the slope, and dy/dx = m. So, k = -g m. But the problem might expect a positive value, so perhaps k = g m.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I should consider direction. If moving upwards, the weight change would be negative, but perhaps the problem is considering the magnitude. So, the magnitude of dw would be mg times the component of the slope, which is g times the slope, so k = g times the slope.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case, for a parabola y = ax², the slope at any point is 2ax. So, k = g * 2ax = 2agx. But since x can be expressed in terms of y, because y = ax², x = sqrt(y/a). Therefore, k = 2ag * sqrt(y/a) = 2g * sqrt(a y)/a? Wait, that seems a bit convoluted. Alternatively, since we're dealing with a derivative, perhaps the slope m is dy/dx, so m = 2ax, so k = g m = 2agx.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem might just be considering that the weight increases by an amount proportional to the distance moved, and the constant of proportionality is twice the slope times g. Alternatively, perhaps it's expecting the answer in terms of the slope.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, the key point is that dw = k ds implies that k = dw/ds = -mg (dy/dx). So, the proportionality constant k is -mg times the derivative of y with respect to x, which is the slope of the parabola. Since the problem didn't specify a particular parabola or any specific values, the answer would be in terms of the slope of the parabola and the gravitational constant g. Therefore, the constant of proportionality k is equal to the product of g and the slope of the parabolic path at the point of movement.\n",
