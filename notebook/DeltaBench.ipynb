But since there's only one red ball in each bag initially, and now Bob has two red balls after receiving one from Alice, he could give one of the red balls back.\\n\\nBut actually, since each bag initially has only one of each color, and Alice is giving one to Bob, Bob now has two of that color.\\n\\nSo, if Alice gives a red ball to Bob, Bob now has two red balls.\\n\\nThen, when Bob picks a ball to give back, he has six balls: his original five plus the red one from Alice.\\n\\nSo, he has two red balls now.\\n\\nIf he picks one to give back to Alice, there's a probability that he picks the red one or one of the others.\\n\\nIf he picks the red one that Alice gave him, then Alice gets her red ball back, and Bob is left with his original red ball.\\n\\nIn that case, both bags would have the original five balls, same as before.\\n\\nIf Bob picks one of his original balls to give back to Alice, say he picks green, then:\\n\\n- Alice has her four original balls (excluding the red one she gave) plus the green one from Bob.\\n\\n- Bob has his five original balls plus the red one from Alice, minus the green one he gave to Alice.\\n\\nSo, Alice now has B, O, R, V (if she gave red), plus green from Bob.\",\n",
